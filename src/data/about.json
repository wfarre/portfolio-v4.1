  "I am a front-end web developer specializing in React and currently, I am living in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. I can speak French, English and Japanese. I use mainly HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Sass but I am also familiar with Redux and Jest for testing. ",
  "Before becoming a web developer, I worked in the service industry for 10 years, including 3 years in Japan where I worked in the travel/hospitality industry. ",
  "Why did I choose web development? I have always been interested in programming. When I was working in the travel industry, I had to use excel/ google sheets, and I really enjoyed making formula to do my work more efficiently. In 2020, I bought course on Udemy about Web development, I loved it immediately. ",
  "I finished the course, then I practiced HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Sass for 6 months. Then, I decided to deepen my knowledge in front-end web development and to be more job ready, I enrolled the “Front-end web developer - Javascript React”. There, I deepen my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I also learned unitary tests using Jest and store management using Redux."
